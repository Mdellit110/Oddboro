# Contributing

Thanks for helping. Oddboro is licensed Apache-2.0 (`LICENSE`), and
anything you contribute comes in under that license.

## Sign off every commit

Every commit in a pull request carries a sign-off under the
[Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/). It says
you wrote the change, or have the right to submit it, under the project's
license.

1. Make sure git knows your real name and email:
   `git config user.name` and `git config user.email`.
2. Commit with `-s`: `git commit -s -m "Fix the chair clash"`.
3. Check the commit ends with a line like
   `Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>`.

Forgot one? `git commit --amend -s` fixes the last commit, and
`git rebase --signoff main` fixes every commit on your branch.

## Before you open a pull request

1. Create `data/private-words.txt` once: one word per line, with your names
   and account names. Git ignores `data/`, and `npm run lint` fails until the
   file exists, so none of those words slips into a commit.
2. Run the three checks from the repo root. Each must report zero problems.

   ```sh
   npm run lint
   npm run check-types
   npm run format:check
   ```

The rules behind them are in `CLAUDE.md`.

## The name

The license covers the code, not the Oddboro name. A fork needs a name of
its own.
