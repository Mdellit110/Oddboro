    <h2 class="font-pixel text-ink text-2xl">What Open Brain is</h2>
    <p class="text-muted mt-3 leading-relaxed">
      Open Brain is a memory you own. It is a database of your thoughts, notes and ideas that any AI
      tool can search and add to, so they all remember the same things about you. You run it
      yourself, on your own Supabase project. Nate B. Jones made it, and it lives on GitHub.

      Open a chat with the Odd and ask, “What have I saved about this week?” It searches your Open
